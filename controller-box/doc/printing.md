## Printing guide


### Intro

These are the main parts of the project:

- the controller box
- the led caps

Of course you can use the filament colors you prefer but
ideally the project is designed to be printed with this ones:

- **matte black** for the controller box
- **transparent** for the led caps

Here are some suggestions:

- **matte black**:  [Overture Matte Black pla filament](https://www.amazon.it/gp/product/B08X6YWZBT) [★★★★★].
- **transparent**:  [Giantarm Transparent pla filament](https://www.amazon.it/gp/product/B08LZ7L7L1) [★★★★☆]. You can avoid to print the led caps and use these [LED lampshade with light guide column cap](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005002316760848.html)

**No supports are needed**.


### Controller box

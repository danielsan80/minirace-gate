## Printing guide


### Intro

These are the main parts of the project:

- the basements (blocks to place the gate on)
- the gate (uprights, angles and traverse)
- the boltings (bolts help you to place the gate on something other than the basements)
- the starglights (the cover to put on the startlights module)
- the hanger (clips and rod allow you to hang up the startlights module on the gate traverse).

Of course you can use only one filament colors and in case paint it but
ideally the project is designed to be printed in different ones:

- **cement gray** for the basements
- **silver** for the gate, the hanger clips and the boltings
- **matte black** for the startlights cover and the hanger rod

Here are some suggestions:

- **cement gray**: [Giantarm Silver pla filament](https://www.amazon.it/Filamento-GIANTARM-Stampante-Spool-Argento/dp/B07PV5KD6S) [★★★★☆]. It is a silver, not a gray, but we like it and is a good quality brand.
- **silver**: [Noulei Silk Silver pla filament](https://www.amazon.it/Noulei-Filamento-stampanti-Printing-Filament/dp/B07PRX7X4B) [★★★☆☆]. It is a silk silver, we like it but after a while we preferred to use [Giantarm Silver pla filament](https://www.amazon.it/Filamento-GIANTARM-Stampante-Spool-Argento/dp/B07PV5KD6S) [★★★★☆] because  is more strong and cohesive: it is not a silk pla but it is a better quality filament and the gate looks good.
- **matte black**:  [Overture Matte Black pla filament](https://www.amazon.it/gp/product/B08X6YWZBT) [★★★★★].

**No supports are needed**. The startlights rod has an integrated support to remove at post-printing time.


### Basements

Basements are created to convey the cars under the gate, preventing they crashed into the uprights.

To do this they should have a trapezoidal base, but currently they have a rectangular base.

With a rectangular base they are not so useful (they are a WIP).

Anyway, if you want to print this version...

- basement.stl (x 2) [**cement gray**]

### Bolting

If you want to place the gate on something other than the provided basements
or directly on the track you can print the boltings and glue them on it.

- bolting.stl (x 2) [**silver**]

> Note: right now the basement has not integrated bolts but it should in the future (it is a WIP).
> So, for now, you can glue the boltings on the basements too.


### Gate

You can print tha gate and place it on the basements or not: your choice.

- upright.stl (x 2) [**silver**]
- upright_stick.stl (x 8) [**silver**]

- angle.stl (x 2) [**silver**]

- traverse_L_160mm.stl (x 1) [**silver**]
- traverse_R_160mm.stl (x 1) [**silver**]
- traverse_stick_1of3.stl (x 2) [**silver**]
- traverse_stick_2of3.stl (x 2) [**silver**]
- traverse_stick_3of3.stl (x 2) [**silver**]

Optionally you can print the 270mm variant:

- ~~traverse_L_160mm.stl (x 1) [**silver**]~~
- ~~traverse_R_160mm.stl (x 1) [**silver**]~~
- traverse_L_270mm.stl (x 1) [**silver**]
- traverse_R_270mm.stl (x 1) [**silver**]


### Startlights

If you have the startlights module you need the cover to put on it:

- startlights.stl (x1) [**matte black**]

To hang it to the gate you need to print the hanger:

- hanger_rod (x1) [**matte black**]
- hanger_clip (x2) [**silver**]

There is a generic clip variant that allows you to hang the startlights on what you want (a 3-5mm thick bar for example)

- hanger_clip_generic (x2) [**matte black**]


That's all!

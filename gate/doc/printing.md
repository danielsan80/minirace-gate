## Printing guide


### Intro

These are the main parts of the project:

- the basements (controller box and terminal box)
- the gate (uprights, angles and traverse)
- the boltings (bolts and guides allow you to combine the basements and the gate)
- the starglights (the cover to put on the startlights module)
- the hanger (clips and rod allow you to hang up the startlights module on the gate traverse.

Of course you can use only one filament colors and in case paint it but
ideally the project is designed to be printed in different ones:

- **cement gray** for the basements
- **silver** for the gate, the hanger clips and the boltings
- **matte black** for the startlights cover and the hanger rod
- **transparent** for the basement led caps

Here are some suggestions:

- **cement gray**: [Giantarm Silver pla filament](https://www.amazon.it/Filamento-GIANTARM-Stampante-Spool-Argento/dp/B07PV5KD6S) [★★★★☆]. It is a silver, not a gray, but we like it and is a good quality brand.
- **silver**: [Noulei Silk Silver pla filament](https://www.amazon.it/Noulei-Filamento-stampanti-Printing-Filament/dp/B07PRX7X4B) [★★★☆☆]. It is a silk silver, we like it but after a while we preferred to use [Giantarm Silver pla filament](https://www.amazon.it/Filamento-GIANTARM-Stampante-Spool-Argento/dp/B07PV5KD6S) [★★★★☆] because  is more strong and cohesive: it is not a silk pla but it is a better quality filament and the gate looks good.
- **matte black**:  [Overture Matte Black pla filament](https://www.amazon.it/gp/product/B08X6YWZBT) [★★★★★].
- **transparent**:  [Giantarm Transparent pla filament](https://www.amazon.it/gp/product/B08LZ7L7L1) [★★★★☆]. You can avoid to print the led caps and use these [LED lampshade with light guide column cap](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005002316760848.html)


**No supports are needed**. The startlights rod has an integrated support to remove at post-printing time.


### Controller box

Printing the controller box is **the only thing required** to get started.

- basement_box_controller_bottom.stl (x 1) [**cement gray**]
- basement_box_controller_side_slide.stl (x 1) [**cement gray**]
- basement_box_controller_top.stl (x 1) [**cement gray**]
- basement_box_controller_top_led_hole (x 2) [**transparent**]
- basement_box_controller_top_hole_cap.stl (x 1) [**cement gray**] (optional, useful only if you don't use the startlights module)


### Terminal box

If you want to use the controller box as basement for the gate you should print the terminal box too.

- basement_box_terminal_bottom.stl (x 1) [**cement gray**]
- basement_box_terminal_side_slide.stl (x 1) [**cement gray**]
- basement_box_terminal_top.stl (x 1) [**cement gray**]


### Bolting and guides

After printing the terminal box you should print the boltings and the guides to glue them on the top of the basement boxes.

- bolting.stl (x 1) [**silver**]
- basement_box_controller_bolting_guide.stl (x 1) [**any**]
- basement_box_terminal_bolting_guide.stl (x 1) [**any**]

After glueing the boltings on the boxes you can throw avay the guides.


### Gate

You can print tha gate and place it on the basement boxes or not: your choice.

- upright.stl (x 2) [**silver**]
- upright_stick.stl (x 8) [**silver**]

- angle.stl (x 2) [**silver**]

- traverse_L_160mm.stl (x 1) [**silver**]
- traverse_R_160mm.stl (x 1) [**silver**]
- traverse_stick_1of3.stl (x 2) [**silver**]
- traverse_stick_2of3.stl (x 2) [**silver**]
- traverse_stick_3of3.stl (x 2) [**silver**]

Optionally you can print the 270mm variant:

- ~~traverse_L_160mm.stl (x 1) [**silver**]~~
- ~~traverse_R_160mm.stl (x 1) [**silver**]~~
- traverse_L_270mm.stl (x 1) [**silver**]
- traverse_R_270mm.stl (x 1) [**silver**]


### Startlights

If you have the startlights module you need the cover to put on it:

- startlights.stl (x1) [**matte black**]

To hang it to the gate you need to print the hanger:

- hanger_rod (x1) [**matte black**]
- hanger_clip (x2) [**silver**]

There is a generic clip variant that allows you to hang the startlights on what you want (a 3-5mm thick bar for example)

- hanger_clip_generic (x2) [**matte black**]
